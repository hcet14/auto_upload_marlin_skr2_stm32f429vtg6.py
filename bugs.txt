Known bugs:
  
1. SDcard could not be written:
    Error in ABM: OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '<path of SDcard>':
    Well, it's not a bug in my script, but it happens to me sometimes. The permissions of SDcard screwed up, I don't know why (script can not write, delete, or remame files on SDcard) 
    This is the fix:
    sudo fdisk -l, look for the path of your SDcard, for me /dev/sdc1 for example
    sudo chown -hR <user> <path of SDcard>, for me sudo chown -hR user /dev/sdc1
    sudo chmod -R 777 <path of SDcard>, for me sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/sdc1 
    sudo mount --options remount,rw <path of SDcard>, for me sudo mount --options remount,rw /dev/sdc1

    You can also use the script sdcard_permissions.sh (change the path to your SDcard)!
  
    Error in ABM: *** [upload] /media/hcet/CPOC/firmware.bin: Read-only file system
    Close all open file managers and do above fix again.  

I have no clue how to implement this in the script. It's caused by the mounting process of my Ubuntu. I guess every other linux installation will behave different. Any help of an experienced programmer is appreciated!
