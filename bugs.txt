Known bugs:
  
1. SDcard could not be written:
    Error in ABM: OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '<path of SDcard>':
    Well, it's not a bug in my script, but it happens to me sometimes. The permissions of SDcard screwed up, I don't know why (script can not write, delete, or remame files on SDcard) 
    This is the fix:
    Close all open file managers.
    sudo fdisk -l, look for the path of your SDcard, for me /dev/sdc1 for example
    sudo chown -hR <user> <path of SDcard>, for me sudo chown -hR user /dev/sdc1
    sudo chmod -R 777 <path of SDcard>, for me sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/sdc1 
    sudo mount --options remount,rw <path of SDcard>, for me sudo mount --options remount,rw /dev/sdc1

    You can also use the script sdcard_permissions.sh (change the path to your SDcard)!
  
    Error in ABM: *** [upload] /media/hcet/CPOC/firmware.bin: Read-only file system
    Do above fix again.  
    
If the script did run once, it will behave stable until you boot your PC again.

Maybe doing an entry in fstab for the SDcard of SKR 2 is a fix (didn't try yet).

I have no clue how to implement this in the script. It's caused by the mounting process of my Ubuntu. I guess every other linux installation will behave different. Any help of an experienced programmer is appreciated!
